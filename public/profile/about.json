    "about": "I’m a Python-focused backend developer with a strong track record in designing and building robust APIs, automating complex workflows, and managing data-intensive applications. I thrive on solving real-world problems through clean, efficient, and maintainable code.\n\nOver the years, I’ve worked extensively with frameworks like Django, Django REST Framework, and FastAPI, integrating authentication systems, managing complex database relationships, and handling external APIs. I also have solid experience with deployment on Linux servers, containerization with Docker, and orchestration with Docker Compose and Kubernetes.\n\nMy passion lies in leveraging Python to simplify processes, optimize performance, and deliver reliable backend solutions. While I’m primarily backend-focused, I’m comfortable connecting my APIs to frontend interfaces and ensuring seamless integrations.\n\nI enjoy tackling challenging technical problems, whether it’s automating data pipelines, processing Excel files, or integrating third-party services like payment platforms, always aiming for scalable and maintainable solutions.",
